Problem 4

Parameter estimation can be easier for an unstable system because a smaller set of parameters make the system stable or track a trajectory.  For a stable system, many values may achieve the same performance so the adaptive system will only change the values enough to ensure stability.  These values are unlikely to be the same as the plant for a stable system.
